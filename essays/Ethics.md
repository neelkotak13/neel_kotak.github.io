# Introduction
This is a commentary on [this](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/the-code-im-still-ashamed-of-e4c021dff55e) article. Now, in a situation
like this, is the software engineer at fault? I'll compare this to the Nuremberg trials, where Nazi soldiers were tried for crimes
they committed in the holocaust and WWII.

# "I was just following orders"
Like the Nazi Soldiers, software engineers have somewhat of an obligation to the higher authority that employs them. Although
the soldiers had much more pressure and obligation to follow what they were being told, the court has NEVER accepted the "I was
just following orders" argument as an excuse. Any sane person should know what they're doing and you are ultimately responsible
for your own actions. In the case of the software engineer, if you purposefully do something unethical, like program a quiz that
will falsely always give you a single answer as the linked article does; you are responsible for your actions and you must accept
the consequences.

# Responsibility
I think that if you are a software engineer, and you get an order to do something that may be unethical, asking senior leadership
for guidance is the first part, but if that fails, I would refuse to do the project. The consequences of that are most likely losing
your job, or at least promotion opportunities. But, the weight that the author has to bear is worse, when your work causes the
death of another, or some unintended complication that you did not understand prior actually doing the project. In the end, you
are responsible for your actions, and you have a moral obligation on top of your work obligations. If you create
software and it is used for good, but goes into the wrong hands and causes harm, that ultimately is not you're fault.
Many may feel like they are at fault for creating the harm, but think of all the good the software has done, because
responsibility goes both ways; you take ownership if things go right, and you take the same ownership when they go wrong.

# Conclusion
In the end, an individual is responsible for their own actions and that means they should be ready to bear the consequences.
I read a lot of Marcus Aurelius and love the stoic philosophy. My favorite Marcus Aurelius quote is the epitome of how I wish to
live life: "If it is not right, do not do it; if it is not true, do not say it. Easier said than done, but staying vigilant in
what you do is important.
