# Is It Glamorous?
I recently started learning JavaScript through my Software Engineering class and I must say, I like
the shortcuts and non complicated way it works. Compared to the programming languages like C, C++, 
Java, and Lisp, it is much more relaxed. It allows you to return different value types from a single
function (can return String or int data types within same function), arrays do not have to have a type
and can have all different types in them. I think JavaScript is a bad "first" language to learn as it
will make you lazy and when using other languages, will make trivial mistakes. Or worse, the trivial
mistakes will become bad habits and can be even more costlier and frustrating. But, the capabilities
and freedom it seems to allow the programmer to have make it a very powerful language. The language 
may not be the most glamorous, but the experience definitely is. 

# Athletic Software Engineering
In the same Software Engineering class, we have a Workout Of the Day (WOD) and it is a simple problem
which you would practice solving everyday, until you can solve it at a proficient speed. The goal is 
to teach a concept and ingrain the practical use of it in your brain. I found these practice WODs to
be very useful, as it teaches to answer questions in a reasonable amount of time and makes your rethink
your problem solving process. Critical thinking skills will be very useful in any career field and life
in general. Although it is sometimes stressful, it makes you accustomed to the environment and allows 
you to be able to do quick thinking which will most likely come in handy in the future. It definitely,
works for me!
