# Introduction
Having never used HTML and CSS prior to a class in college, I was filled with anxiety. I did not know
what to expect, but I quickly was being told that HTML and CSS were not difficult and rather easy.
To my delight, it was, but I was upset, because my web pages were neither elegant or beautiful like
those that I see on the internet. I thought that I need to broaden my knowledge of HTML and CSS, but 
was told by a classmate to just use "bootstrap", and I had heard of the word before, but never knew what
it was.

# Semantic UI
Although I first heard of bootstrap, my software engineering class taught and used Semantic UI. At first,
I was perplexed with the different types of elements, collections, and variations, but I continued watching
tutorials on basic Semantic UI. Then after maybe 3 or 4 hours of video, I was able to recreate the beautiful
webpages I so envied a couple weeks before. Although, I still have a lot to learn, I learned how to 
create professional level, elegant webpages in a relatively short amount of time. 

# Conclusion
I definitely have a long way to go with UI Frameworks, especially with Semantic UI, but it definitely
get you up to speed on modern frameworks in a very short period of time. Although the page may seem generic
at first, it will look elegant and professional. Once I get more experience, I feel my pages will be 
more unique and distinct, rather than a generic page made from Semantic UI.
