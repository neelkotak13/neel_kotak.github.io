# Introduction
I read this interesting [guide](http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions.html) by Eric Steven
Raymond and Rick Moen. This guide gave a detailed and specific way to write questions online in a way
to elicit the best responses. I highly recommend reading this guide, as it gives plenty of guidance
on trivial mistakes.

# The Not So Smart Way
We can see that [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39498106/dynamically-add-nodes-in-a-jtree) question violates many of the principles outlined in the guide. There is no
prior research attempt shown, no prior solving attempt, and shows absolutely abysmal effort.
The problem seems like a homework problem, and the person is simply looking for a solution, which is
against another ethical principle, as homework assignments are made to teach, and soliciting answers is
frowned upon in the community. Overall, there was a single response, as most people simply saw
that this person put no effort and wants the answer spoon fed to him/her. The question also has many downvotes,
likely for the lack of elaboration. There was also a response to have the person elaborate on his/her own attempts, which was ignored. This is the definition of asking questions the wrong way.

# The Smart Way
Now, [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6841333/why-is-subtracting-these-two-times-in-1927-giving-a-strange-result) question shows that the user attempted to solve the problem and even showed test cases for those
answering to work with. It precisely describes the problem and then shows what version of Java, which build,
and how he obtains his time inputs. Now there are many high quality answers, and this problem took some
back and forth communication to solve. The answer is also bizarre, I recommend you read it, nonetheless
a much more difficult question than the previous, but we get better and more clear answers here than in
previous question. Likely because by describing the problem and our attempt at a solution in depth, we make it more interesting and challenging.

# Conclusion
Although it is rash to say that asking questions the "smart" way will elicit better and higher
quality responses based off this small sample size, we can definitely understand why we would get higher quality responses if we asked the "smart" way. Showing effort, being clear and concise, and
providing relevant information makes everything easier and more fun to solve, especially if the
problem is a rather tough one. As Socrates once said "The only true wisdom is in knowing you know nothing." Drop
the ego and keep asking questions to get a deeper understanding.
