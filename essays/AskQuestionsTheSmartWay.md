# Introduction
I read this interesting [guide](http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions.html) by Eric Steven 
Raymond and Rick Moen. This guide gave a detailed and specific way to write questions online in a way 
to elicit the best responses. I highly reccommend reading this guide, as it gives plenty of guidance
on trival mistakes.

# [The Not So Smart Way](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39498106/dynamically-add-nodes-in-a-jtree)
We can see that this question violates many of the principles outlined in the guide. There is no 
prior research attempt shown, no prior solving attempt, and shows absolutely abysmal effort. The problem 
The problem seems like a homework problem, and the person is simply looking for a solution, which is
against another principle, as homework assignments are made to teach, and soliciting answers is 
frowned upon in the community. Overall, there was a single response, as most people simply saw
that this person put no effort and wants the answers to be spoon fed to him/her. There was also a 
response to have the person elaborate on his/her own attempts, which was ignored. This is the definition
of asking a question a stupid way.

# [The Smart Way](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6841333/why-is-subtracting-these-two-times-in-1927-giving-a-strange-result)
Now, this question shows that the user attempted to solve the problem and even showed test cases for those
answering to work with. It precisely describes the problem and then shows what version of Java, which build,
and how he obtains his time inputs. Now there are many high quality answers, and this problem took some
back and forth communication to solve. The answer is also bizzare, I reccommend you read it, nonetheless
a more difficult question than the previous, but we get better and more clear answers here than in
previous question.

# Conclusion
Although it is rash to say that asking questions the "smart" way will elicit better and higher
qualiy responses based off this small sample size, we can definitely understand why we would get higher quality responses if we asked the "smart" way. Showing effort, being clear and concise, and 
providing relevant information makes everything easier and more fun to solve, especially if the
problem is a rather tough one. As Socrates once said "The only true wisdom is in knowing you know nothing."
