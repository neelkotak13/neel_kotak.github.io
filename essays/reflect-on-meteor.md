# Introduction
Meteor, from my experience is very tricky and following along with the tutorials, I thought to myself 
"There's no way that I would be able to do this myself". Then, when I was feeling bold, I attempted recreating 
one of my assignments in my Software Engineering class, it was called digits. I failed miserably, the
only thing I truly know is the structure and importance of importing all your files in Meteor.

# The Good
The way the file structure works is intuitive, you would have HTML files, and corresponding Javascript
files for their actions. There would be an "index.js" file in each directory which would import the files
into the main project. 

# The Bad
The syntax and learning what must be done in, especially for an event, and how to manipulate collections
can sometimes be very easy; other times not so much. The running of meteor also slows down my computer
quite a bit. I've had my laptop completely freeze in the middle of work, just because meteor is running in the background.

# Conclusion
Like all things, meteor has some great things about it, and some not so great things. But, the more
I practice and use it, I am sure the positives will definitely outshine the negatives.
